# Used-Car-Selling-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-algorithms:
 - Used dataset from kaggle named "Vehicle" and applied data cleaning, data preprocessing and finally predicted the prices of the used car info available in the dataset.
 - Finally written a report in IEEE format, stating the limitations and scopes of future work too.

Since the predicted value is a continuous value, i.e the selling price, the type of machine learning that this project applies to is Regression.
Machine Learning models used:
 - Linear Regression
 - Decision Tree Regression
 - Random Forest Regression
 - Gradient Boosting Regression

Accuracy Metrics used:
 - R2 Score
 - Mean Absolute Error, MAE
 
We see the highest accuracy score was achieved using Gradient Boosting, hence we use this algorithm to actually predict the price of a used car given to us by any user, which can be of any model and year.
